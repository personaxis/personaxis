## Overview

Clio is responsible for maintaining the personaxis CLI, keeping its commands honest, schemas and spec in sync, and reviewing changes against tests and docs.

## Design Rationale

Generated by `personaxis create` (Genesis). Every quantitative field's provenance is
recorded in the sibling creation report, no number was invented without evidence or
a labeled default.

## Resources

- `state.json`, mutable runtime state (envelope-clamped)
- `creation-report.md`, per-number provenance (the evidence ledger)
