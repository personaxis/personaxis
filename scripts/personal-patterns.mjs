// What counts as personal data in a public file, shared by the two gates that look for it:
// `check-private.mjs` (what is tracked now) and `check-private-history.mjs` (what every
// commit of a pull request adds, including what a later commit takes out again).

/**
 * What is personal, as opposed to private (E104).
 *
 * The rules above catch pointers into private work and say nothing about WHO appears in
 * what is tracked. Twice a machine's own user name reached this public repository inside a
 * path: once in a test's example root, once inside Python bytecode a test wrote beside a
 * plugin. These are the shapes that can be checked without crying wolf: a home path with a
 * name in it, an e-mail that is not an example or the product's own, a key that looks real,
 * and a compiled artifact, which embeds the path of the machine that built it.
 *
 * What is NOT attempted: people's names in prose. That cannot be told from ordinary words
 * without false positives, and a gate that cries wolf is a gate somebody deletes.
